Install via composer init-project
=================================

The quickest way to install a testeable version of the Elcodi platform is using `Composer`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer create-project elcodi/elcodi --stability=dev

This will checkout the latest version of Elcodi and install all its dependencies.

 .. note::
 	Installing ``elcodi/elcodi`` via ``composer init-project`` will checkout the *whole* project, basically you will get all the bundles. Look at the section `Using individual bundles`_ to see how to work only with the components that you need.
